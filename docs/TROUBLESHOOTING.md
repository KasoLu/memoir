# Troubleshooting

This guide covers the most common setup and runtime issues for Memoir.

## Summary Generation Fails

### Shared API mode

Check that SillyTavern itself can generate a normal chat reply first.

If the main chat API is already failing, Memoir cannot build a summary through the shared path.

### Independent API mode

Memoir's independent mode requires both:

- `API URL`
- `Model`

If either field is empty, Memoir falls back to the shared API path instead of using the independent endpoint.

If both fields are filled and generation still fails:

- Verify the endpoint is OpenAI-compatible.
- Verify the URL points to the API base or `/v1/chat/completions`.
- Verify the API key is valid if the provider requires one.
- Verify the selected model name is accepted by that endpoint.

## Fetch Models Returns Empty

`Fetch Models` requests `GET /v1/models` from the configured API URL.

Check these points:

- The configured URL is reachable from the browser running SillyTavern.
- The provider exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint.
- The API key is correct if the provider requires authentication.
- The server actually returns model IDs in a `data` array or simple list.

If your provider does not support `/v1/models`, you can type the model name manually.

## The Summary Was Confirmed But The AI Still Ignores It

Check these points:

- `Auto Inject Approved` is enabled.
- The current chat already has confirmed summary text.
- The selected injection layer matches your prompt stack expectations.

Also note:

- `Chat Injection Layer` is not an absolute final slot.
- `Layer Depth = 0` only means "try to stay close to the latest message".
- If another extension uses the same layer and depth, SillyTavern still decides final ordering.

If you need more stable behavior, use `Character Layer` instead of `Chat Injection Layer`.

## Custom Prompt Editing Broke Generation

Memoir lets you rewrite the built-in prompt templates, but the user template still needs these variables:

- `{{start_floor}}`
- `{{end_floor}}`
- `{{chat_history}}`

The system prompt has no required variables.

If generation suddenly becomes empty or unusable after prompt edits, restore the missing variables first.

## Approved Ranges Show As Changed

This means the original source messages no longer match the hash saved at approval time.

Typical causes:

- You edited chat messages after confirming a summary.
- You deleted part of the summarized message range.
- The selected range now points to different message content.

This is a soft warning, not a hard lock. Existing summary injection still works, but the stored summary may no longer match the current chat history.

## Merge & Compress Output Looks Off

Check these points:

- The confirmed summaries already contain the text you want to preserve.
- Your fusion prompt is still aligned with your preferred archive format.
- The configured output length is not too short for the amount of material being merged.

If needed, edit the merged result manually before continuing.

If merge returns empty content:

- Memoir retries once with reinforced recovery prompts.
- If the retry still returns empty content, Memoir preserves the selected original summaries as a manual-revision block instead of deleting them.
- If clicking merge again later succeeds, the provider likely returned an intermittent empty response on the first attempt.
- Refresh the SillyTavern page after updating Memoir, so the browser loads the newest extension files.

## Mobile Or Narrow Panel Feels Crowded

Memoir supports smaller screens, but long prompt editing is more comfortable in fullscreen mode.

If the normal textarea feels cramped:

- Open the fullscreen editor for prompt fields.
- Open the fullscreen summary editor when reviewing long cumulative summaries.

## Before Reporting A Bug

Collect these details:

- Memoir version
- SillyTavern version
- Whether you used shared API or independent API
- The exact steps that reproduce the issue
- The error message shown in the UI, if any
